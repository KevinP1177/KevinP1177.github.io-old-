<h2> About <em> ME </em> </h2>
<h3> A small synapse of me and my interests</h3> 
</center>
<p id="second"><img id="face" src="image3.png">My name is Kevin Francisco Paulino, I am a <a href="http://uri.edu">URI</a> student majoring in Computer Science. So far I have taken the CS classes CSC 160. I am 18 years old and I was born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island but I am 100% Dominican. I am a full-time student and plan to graduate in 2026 with my peers. I am a very avid endorser of the try and try again philosophy.<br><br></p>

<p id="second"><img id="face2" src="image2.png">In my free time, I like hanging out with friends and going for walks. I'll watch any movie or sport you put in front of me and will probably enjoy it. I do like baseball better than other sports, although I don't have a favorite team. Not very picky with the things I like. I'll give anything a try at least once. Although I typically like most things I don't like crowded areas like cities or malls. <br><br></p>

<p id="third">I chose URI because it has the advantages that I wanted for computer science and engineering. It is also a beautiful campus that's surrounded by my wilderness so I like that it's not very crowded with strangers from nearby cities or anything like that. I like the fact that most of the people on the campus are for or attending the school.</p>
